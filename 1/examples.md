## Problem 1 :

Given a list of hotels return price range of hotels a given search result ?


#### Solution 1 : 

Comparing with each other 

Complexity : Quadratic, $O(n^2)$



#### Solution 2 : 

Tracking min and max 

One loop for finding max and one for finding min.

Complexity : Linear, $2*O(n)$


### Solution 3  :

What if list is already sorted ?

First one is min and last one is max;

Complexity 2  : Constant , $O(2)$
