# Sorting Types

We can categorize sorting algorithms with two groups.

## Naive Sorts 

Keep looping and comparing values until list is sorted .They are quadratic time $O(n^2)$

- Bubble Sort

- Insertion Sort

- Selection Sort


## Divide & Conquer Sorts

Recursively divide lists and sort smaller parts of list until entire list is sorted.

They are logarithmic  time $O(nlogn)$
